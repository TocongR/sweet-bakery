                        Sweet Dreams Bakery was born from a simple yet powerful dream: to bring the authentic taste of artisan breads and pastries to our community. Founded in 2021 by Sarah and Michael Thompson, our bakery represents years of passion, dedication, and a deep love for the craft of baking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                        After traveling through Europe and experiencing the incredible bakeries of France, Italy, and Germany, Sarah and Michael knew they wanted to recreate that magic here at home. They spent two years perfecting their recipes, learning traditional techniques, and sourcing the finest ingredients.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        What started as weekend farmers market sales quickly grew into something much bigger when the community fell in love with our handcrafted breads and pastries. The demand was clear – our neighborhood needed a dedicated bakery that prioritized quality, tradition, and heart.

                        Every morning at 4 AM, our bakers begin the sacred ritual of bringing fresh bread and pastries to life. The process starts with checking our sourdough starters, some of which have been maintained for over three years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                        By 5 AM, the first loaves are shaping, and the aroma of fresh bread begins to fill the bakery. Our croissants are rolled and shaped by hand, our Danish pastries are filled with seasonal fruits and creams, and our signature sourdough begins its final rise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        When we open our doors at 6 AM, everything is fresh from the oven – exactly as it should be. This commitment to freshness is what sets us apart and keeps our community coming back day after day.
